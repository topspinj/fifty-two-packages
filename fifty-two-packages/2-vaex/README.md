# 2. Vaex

### Review 

**Overall: B**

- Documentation: 4/5
- Ease of use: 4/5
- Maintenance: 3/5

I think I'm biased in this review because I reviewed Polars first, which really blew my mind. 

If I had to choose between Polars and Vaex for handling an extra large dataset, I'd pick Polars without a doubt.
